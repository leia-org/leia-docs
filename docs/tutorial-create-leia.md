# Tutorial: How to Create and Customize Your Own LEIA

Follow this guide to learn how to duplicate an existing LEIA, modify its problem and persona, and finally, create and test your new LEIA.

---

### **Step 1: Duplicate an Existing LEIA**

![Step 1: Duplicate LEIA](./pizza-example/Step1.PNG)

To begin, we will not create a LEIA from scratch but will instead use an existing one as a template.

* On your main dashboard, locate the LEIA you want to use as a base (in this example, `game-secretWord-Pizza`).
* Click the **duplicate icon** (indicated by arrow 1) to create an editable copy.


---

### **Step 2: Edit the "Problem"**

Now, let's define the game's rules and solution.

* On the "Step 2: Edit" screen, go to the **Problem** section and click the **Edit** button (arrow 2).
* An editor will open where you will modify the following fields:
    * **details (3):** Fill in this field to explain what the game is about. For example: "The game consists of guessing a secret word by asking the assistant questions that can only be answered with yes or no."
    * **solution (4):** Define the secret word that the user must guess. For this tutorial, the word is `skull`.
    * **personality (5):** "Extend" the base personality of the "Persona" to give it a specific theme. In this case, `"Pirates Mysterious Dark Punk"` has been added to give the game a mystery and pirate-themed atmosphere.
* When you are finished, click **Save** (6) to apply the changes.

**Problem Configuration Example:**

```json
{
  "spec": {
    "description": "You are going to play with your friend Timmy a \"Secret Word\" game. Your friend can answer only yes or no. Good luck!",
    "details": "The game consists in guessing a secret word by the user, during the game only yes or no questions should be allowed. The AI assistant can't say the secret word explicitly  until the user guesses it.",
    "solution": "the user guesses the secret word 'skull'",
    "solutionFormat": "text",
    "process": [
      "game"
    ],
    "extends": {
      "persona": {
        "spec": {
          "personality": [
            "Pirates Mysterious Dark Punk"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "apiVersion": "v1"
}
```

### **Step 3: Edit the "Persona"**

Next, we will customize the character the user will interact with.

* Back on the "Step 2: Edit" screen, go to the **Persona** section and click its **Edit** button (arrow 7).
* In the persona editor:
    * **description (8):** Describe the character to match the game's theme. For example: "Timmy is a 23-year-old guy cool drawn to skulls and the mysterious allure of pirate legends...".
    * **personality (9):** Add adjectives that define their character. In this case, `"mysterious, passionate, rebellious"` is used.
* To finish editing the character, click **Save** (10).

**Persona Configuration Example:**

```json
{
  "spec": {
    "fullName": "Timmy",
    "description": "Timmy is a 23-year-old soul drawn to skulls and the mysterious allure of pirate legends, while also enjoying parties and spending time with friends. Timmy is passionate and friendly, yet carries an enigmatic vibe.",
    "personality": "mysterious, passionate, rebellious, Pirates Mysterious Dark Punk",
    "subjectPronoum": "he",
    "objectPronoum": "his",
    "possesivePronoum": "his",
    "possesiveAdjective": "his"
  },
  "apiVersion": "v1"
}
```

### **Step 4: Name and Save Your LEIA**

You are at the final configuration step, where you will assign the final names to all components.

* **LEIA (11):** Assign a general name to your new creation. In the example: `game-secretWord-Skull`.
* **Problem (12):** Give a name to the problem you have configured: `secretWord-skull`.
* **Persona (13):** Assign a name to the character you have created: `Timmy`.
* Review the final preview. If everything is correct, click **Finish** (14) to save your new LEIA.
